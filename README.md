# Park App

Park App is a mobile application which connects users who need a place to park with parking spots provided by other users. Just sign-in, find a space, book a time, and you're all set.

Have you ever lost time looking for a parking spot? Been late for a meeting, or a date? Perhaps moving your car for street sweeping takes longer than it should? Or maybe you enjoy attending events like sports games or concerts, but can't stand the traffic jam in the parking lot when trying to leave? If so, Park App is here for you!
